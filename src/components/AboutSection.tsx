              Hello! I'm Ricky, a multidisciplinary engineering student with a passion for building secure, 
              innovative tech solutions. My journey spans across various domains including cybersecurity, 
              IoT development, and full-stack web engineering.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I'm currently pursuing my <span className="text-portfolio-teal">Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering</span> at 
              Christ University, Bangalore, where I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and skills.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As a web developer at Noesis Publishing Services, I built secure web applications with a focus on data privacy 
              and role-based access controls. I'm also proudly serving as the <span className="text-portfolio-teal">Club Head of Scripters</span> at 
              Christ University, where I lead workshops on automation and networking concepts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
